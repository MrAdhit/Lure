# Lure

The true next-gen L7 minecraft proxy and load balancer. Built in Rust, Tokio and Valence.

## Why?

Rust is a powerful programming language and a great development environment with a large and growing ecosystem. The efficiency of the applications built in it is such that several companies are moving their products to this technology.  

Proxies built in Java store too much player data in memory. They have unneeded functions and complex API systems that in the end make a simple proxy whose job is to carry packets from one point to another become an entire server.  

Lure came along to fix that.
